/*Abstract class/method
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * In simple words, if you have some common methods that can be used by 
 * multiple classes go for abstract classes. Else if you want the classes 
 * to follow some definite blueprint go for interfaces.
  
* can not create object
* 
* when abstract method in class compulsory class make abstract
* 
* if you extend abstract class compulsory need to implement abstract method
* 
* abstract method only declaration
* 
* abstract class need to extend Concrete class
* 
* not need write same method repeat use common for all ex:- Animal dog, cat, fish--> common eat, sleep etc   --> uncommon other like flying, digging and walking
*
*
*  Suppose we were modeling the behavior of animals, by creating a class hierachy 
*  that started with a base class called Animal. Animals are capable of doing different 
*  things like flying, digging and walking, but there are some common operations as well 
*  like eating and sleeping. Some common operations are performed by all animals,
*  but in a different way as well. When an operation is performed in a different way,
*  it is a good candidate for an abstract method (forcing subclasses to provide a custom 
*  implementation). Let's look at a very primitive Animal base class, which defines an abstract
*   method for making a sound (such as a dog barking, a cow mooing, or a pig oinking).

	//Each abstract class must have a concrete subclass which will implement the abstract methods of that abstract class. ... The same case applies to abstract classes

	/*Yes, an Abstract class always has a constructor. If you do not define your own constructor, the compiler will give a default constructor to the Abstract class. Above holds true for all classes - nested, abstract, anonymous, etc.

	An abstract class (unlike interface) can have non-final non-static fields which need initialization. You can write your own constructor in the abstract class to do that. But, in that case, there won't be any default constructor.
